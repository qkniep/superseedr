I am preparing to merge my branch to main. 
Review the new changes in this branch to look for regressions or potential enhancements.
Look at the warnings and see if they are expected or not with `cargo check`.
Do not make any changes or commits to the codebase.
Generate suggestions critical items (if any) and keep this review specific to the intent of these changes.
