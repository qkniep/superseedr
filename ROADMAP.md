## Roadmap to V1.0
- **Testing:** Ongoing testing across various platforms and terminals.
- **Unit Testing:** Expansion of unit test coverage.
- **Atomic Config** Configs automatically saved to disk after any change.

## Future (V2.0 and Beyond)

### Refactors 
- **Codebase:** Reduce dependencies by implementing some of these features in the codebase.

### Networking & Protocol
- **Full IPv6 Support:** Allow connecting to IPv6 peers and announcing to IPv6 trackers, including parsing compact peers6 responses.
- **UPnP / NAT-PMP:** Automatically configure port forwarding on compatible routers to improve connectability.
- **Tracker Scraping:** Implement the ability to query trackers for seeder/leecher counts without doing a full announce (useful for displaying stats).
- **Network History:** Persisting network history to disk.
- **Crash Dump Ring Buffer:** Fully replayable crash dump of torrent state actions.

### Torrent & File Management
- **Selective File Downloading:** Allow users to choose which specific files inside a multi-file torrent they want to download.
- **Sequential Downloading:** Download pieces in order, primarily useful for streaming media files while they're downloading.
- **Torrent Prioritization / Queueing:** Allow users to set priorities for torrents and configure limits on the number of active downloading or seeding torrents.
- **Per-Torrent Settings:** Allow setting individual speed limits, ratio goals, or connection limits for specific torrents.
- **Torrent Log book:** Historic log book of all torrents added and deleted. Allows users to search and redownload.
- **Fully asynchronous validation:** Refactor for handling torrent validation and revalidations async.

### User Interface & Experience
- **Docker Detach Mode:** Allow for detached and attach sessions, TUI off mode.
- **Layout Edit Mode:** Allow the user to resize or drag and drop the layout of the panels.
- **RSS Feed Support:** Automatically monitor RSS feeds and download new torrents matching user-defined filters.
- **Advanced TUI Controls:** Add more interactive features to the TUI, like in-app configuration editing, more detailed peer/file views, advanced sorting/filtering.
- **TUI Files View Hierarchy:** Add a popup that shows in an interactive hierarchy view and live progress for the files of the torrent.
